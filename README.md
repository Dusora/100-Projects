Hello!

My name is Dusora, and I created this Github repository as a means of keeping me accountable in my journey of learning Python. For every project I complete from Angela Yu's course, I will be uploading it here.

I am truly excited to see how far I can go with this. If I tap out, then it is what it is, but I know I want to make something from nothing. That is why I enjoy Python.
